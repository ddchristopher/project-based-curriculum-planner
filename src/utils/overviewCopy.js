			We start with planning for this stage because it sets the tone for the whole unit.
			This stage is about defining what we hope students will be able to show that they
			know or can do by the end of the unit. This means deciding on what content and skills
			this unit will focus on, what driving question will animate the work, and what types
			of products can serve as evidence of student learning and growth.
		</p>
		<p>
			We start here because
			the ideas for this stage will inform all of the supports and activities we create in
			stages one through three as well.

			Planning for this stage is about connecting your unit to what students
			already know and getting them excited and motivated about what is to come.
			It’s an important step in starting a unit.

			Having a clear set of objectives for a unit helps clarify not only what we expect
			students to do, but is also the best support for planners in deciding what scaffolds,
			materials, activities, and resources to focus on throughout the unit. By knowing what
			we are building toward, we will better be able to create our entire unit.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is, however, a somewhat iterative process. One may find that they have chose some
			objectives, and a driving question, and through the process of thinking more deeply
			about the products they are hoping to produce, suddenly realize that an objective or
			wording of the question needs adjustment; this is fine -- expect a little back and forth
			through the different questions in this stage. The hope is that, by the end of considering
			these questions, there is a clear destination that we can map toward in other stages.
		</p>
		<p>
			For more information about how to craft strong objectives, come up with ideas for
			projects, generate driving questions, or anything else related to this stage, please
			feel free to examine the artifacts and resources to the right.

		<p>Your students come with a wealth of experiences and knowledge.
			These can and should be used to help build bridges to the new academic
			content you introduce in your classroom. The opportunity to access prior
			knowledge not only serves as a scaffold to new content, but also as a
			motivation for learning.</p>
		<p>Motivating activities or “hooks” for projects are often overlooked in planning.
			This crucial step can provide a lot of mileage in moving students into the
			rich academic content of a project and help to energize them in tackling complex ideas.
			There are numerous activities, strategies, and resources for doing so, which you can
			explore as you plan.</p>
